# tinymceaccessibility
A simple plugin bathks52 and I worked on in JavaScript for the WYSIWYG editor used in Plone as part of an open-source project for a course (Software Engineering 2).

Add as a custom plugin via the TinyMCE options menu in the Plone control panel:
"accesscheck|{location}"

Also be sure to add an entry to the "Tools" menu.
